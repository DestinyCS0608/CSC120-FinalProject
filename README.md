This Boba Game is a work in progess. This game was initial supposed to be a baking game, but I changed it to become a boba game after I went to get boba with some friends. In Gillett, there is a whiteboard in the elevator where students can put surveys or polls for everyone to enter. One time as I was going to my room, a poll was "What is your fav boba order?" I realized that this might be a sign and I decideded to make the change. 

My overall approach was to first sell boba to customers and work out the aesthetics after. I wanted to make sure that I can at least give boba to customers first. I then worked out how to randomize the topping, size, and flavor the order would be, then after assign different prices to them. The aestheticss came after, and I honestly think I got wrapped up into it because I definelty lefy some design choices out that I wanted to implement. For example, I wanted to unlock new flavors, and toppings after the user reaches certain increments of profit like $25, $50, $75, and $100.

Some exciting new things I learned was the loop to print out strings in a typewriter effect. It's so cool! Although, I worked with Hash Maps, I appreciated working with them more, and learning new ways to utlize them, like assinging defeault price values to flavors, toppings, and size. I also learned how to round deicimals using BigDecimal.

I think the most important advice I got was from Jordan, who help me come up with how to allow the customers to complain which helps the user know what they messed up. And I think that if I went back in time, I will tell myself to work on aestheics later and make sure the framework of the game is solidifed first.

I liked to thank eveyrone who helped me with my codebase and other attributes!
